<h1>Week 6 News!</h1>
<h2>Village Vipers defeat Lorenzen Lightning 64-59 in an all time classic!</h2>
<p>There was only one legitimate game played this weekend, but it was a great one. The Vipers were favorites coming into this game, riding a 3 game winning streak, and facing a team missing star player Spencer Webb. The Vipers seemed a little unfocused coming out of the gates and George Povemba capitalized. In what will forever be known as the “Poop Game”, George Povemba dropped 31 points while continuously mentioning he needed to use a bathroom. The Vipers were down 10 in the fourth quarter, but made it a close game thanks to John McCance late game scoring. The Vipers were down five with ten seconds left. After Charlie Hildebrandt hit a three to cut the deficit to 2, Jake Bransfield stole the inbound pass and was fouled. He nailed both free throws to force overtime. The Vipers managed to seal the deal in overtime and win 64-59. Player-coach Lucas Ierodiaconou set a new LBL record with 21 rebounds. Truly remarkable.
